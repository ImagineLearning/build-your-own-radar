Node,Backend,Hold,none,"<p><a href=""https://nodejs.org"">Node</a> is similar in design to, and influenced by, systems like Ruby’s Event Machine and Python’s Twisted. Node.js takes the event model a bit further. It presents an event loop as a runtime construct instead of as a library. In other systems, there is always a blocking call to start the event-loop. Typically, behavior is defined through callbacks at the beginning of a script, and at the end a server is started through a blocking call like EventMachine::run(). In Node.js, there is no such start-the-event-loop call. Node.js simply enters the event loop after executing the input script. Node.js exits the event loop when there are no more callbacks to perform. This behavior is like browser JavaScript — the event loop is hidden from the user.</p>
<p>HTTP is a first-class citizen in Node.js, designed with streaming and low latency in mind. This makes Node.js well suited for the foundation of a web library or framework.</p>
<p>Node.js being designed without threads doesn’t mean you can’t take advantage of multiple cores in your environment. Child processes can be spawned by using our child_process.fork() API, and are designed to be easy to communicate with. Built upon that same interface is the cluster module, which allows you to share sockets between processes to enable load balancing over your cores.</p>

Go,Backend,Hold,budding,"<p><a href=""https://golang.org/"">Go</a> is a C style language with influence from JAVA. Go is expressive, concise, clean, and efficient. Its concurrency mechanisms make it easy to write programs that get the most out of multicore and networked machines, while its novel type system enables flexible and modular program construction.

It has an elegant syntax that is natural to read and easy to write. Rails is a web application development framework written in the Ruby programming language. It is designed to make programming web applications easier by making assumptions about what every developer needs to get started. It allows you to write less code while accomplishing more than many other languages and frameworks. Experienced Rails developers also report that it makes web application development more fun.</p>
<p>Rails is opinionated software. It makes the assumption that there is a “best” way to do things, and it’s designed to encourage that way - and in some cases to discourage alternatives. If you learn “The Rails Way” you’ll probably discover a tremendous increase in productivity. If you persist in bringing old habits from other languages to your Rails development, and trying to use patterns you learned elsewhere, you may have a less happy experience.</p>
<h3>Pros</h3>
<ul>
<li>Highly opinionated syntax and application architecture</li>
<li>Fast development</li>
<li>Large amount of gems available</li>
<li>Very devoted and active community</li>
<li>Convention over configuration</li>

Matillion,Data,Hold,confident,"<p><a href=""https://www.matillion.com/"">Matillion</a> is a purpose-built ETL designer and job engine. It’s a cloud-only product (cannot run locally in virtual machines or docker containers) and supports Redshift and Snowflake. The design canvas has a tree of job definitions and each job definition is represented as a graph of visual components. The user is able to drag and drop the components and alter their properties. Though the intent is largely to expose a point and click interface, it also supports custom SQL in various components and in practice Imagine Learning has used a fair amount of custom SQL.</p>
<p>While the product falls under an ETL umbrella, it is more accurately an ELT engine because the work is mostly executed in the target Redshift or Snowflake engine. In other words, executing a job (scheduled or otherwise) results in the Matillion runtime executing queries against Redshift/Snowflake such that the inputs and outputs of the queries are different tables in Redshift/Snowflake. The Matillion software itself runs on an EC2 instance but the resource utilization is relatively light there. Cost is based on actual EC2 cost plus a licensing fee to Matillion.</p>
<p>Matillion includes support for extraction from many source technologies. The pattern is such that queries can be executed against source systems and the results are placed in the target Redshift / Snowflake, and then transforms are executed in the form of SQL on the target system to move and transform the data to destination tables (such as fact and dimension tables).</p>
<h3>Pros</h3>
<ul>
<li>Potentially quicker to path to working ETL system than custom coded spark/glue/emr/databricks</li>
<li>SQL-centric nature well received by data engineers with extensive SQL background</li>
<li>Support for both Redshift and Snowflake as destination systems</li>
</ul>
<h3>Cons</h3>
<ul>
<li>Cloud-only. No means to execute locally.</li>
<li>Compared to ETL where the majority of the T is done out-of-process from redshift / snowflake, a heaver load is placed on redshift / snowflake.</li>

Athena,Infrastructure,Invest,confident,"<p><a href=""https://aws.amazon.com/athena/"">Amazon Athena</a> is an interactive query service that makes it easy to analyze data in Amazon S3 using standard SQL. Athena is serverless, so there is no infrastructure to manage, and you pay only for the queries that you run.</p>
<p>Athena is easy to use. Simply point to your data in Amazon S3, define the schema, and start querying using standard SQL. Most results are delivered within seconds. With Athena, there’s no need for complex ETL jobs to prepare your data for analysis. This makes it easy for anyone with SQL skills to quickly analyze large-scale datasets.</p>
<h3>Pros</h3>
<ul>
<li>Provides an SQL query interface to structured and semi-structed data stored in S3.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Cons</h3>
<ul>
<li>Without an adequate partitioning strategy and utilization of that strategy as part of the queries, costs to execute can be relatively high. As an example, the student data from L&amp;L / Spanish can cost up to $2.50 per query if the entire S3 dataset is read.  The worst case cost is entirely a function of the size of the dataset which suggests that documentation should exist to provide guidance depending on the dataset.</li>
<li>While Athena supports an ANSI SQL compatibility level, this may not be as full featured as SQL variants supported by other relational databases such as Microsoft SQL Server<br />
In some cases, other technologies like Spark could be a prefered means to query the S3 data.  This might be for performance reasons (more control over the node types that execute the query).</li>
<li>Queries can be costly if care is not taken to bound your query</li>

S3,Infrastructure,Invest,confident,"<p>S3 is a distributed file system. It is highly scalable and has many uses. Recommended usages are diverse. One such scenario: it is the recommended WNE technology for data lakes including two types of zones:</p>

<li>Raw (such as a copy of operational data stores or as the history of operational events)</li>
<li>Curated/gold (post cleanse and transform)</li>
</ol>
<p>Since S3 is a file system, there are many choices for data format. Structured formats include parquet (recommended) and ORC. Semi-structured formats include JSON (recommend JSON per line), XML, and CSV. Unstructured formats include media files such as audio and video.</p>
<p>Related to above, we see it being used as the source of master data (entities) and as the underlying source of analytical data (with replication to serving databases potentially outside S3).</p>
<h3>Pros</h3>
<ul>
<li>Cost effective storage (keep in mind that there are multiple tiers selected based on data access frequency and latency requirements)</li>
<li>High scale</li>
