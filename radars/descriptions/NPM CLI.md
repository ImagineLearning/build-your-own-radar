[NPM CLI](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli-documentation/) is the command line interface for Node Package Manager (NPM).
It can be used for managing dependencies in an application or library, publishing packages to the registry, and running scripts within an application.

### Pros

- Already comes bundled with [Node]().
- Well tested, stable, backed by a large community.

### Cons

- Security concerns with allowing packages to run code on installation automatically.
