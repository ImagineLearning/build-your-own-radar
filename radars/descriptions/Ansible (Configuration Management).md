[Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) is a universal language, unraveling the mystery of how work gets done. Turn tough tasks into repeatable playbooks. Roll out enterprise-wide protocols with the push of a button. 

### Pros
* Simple yaml playbooks
* No server agent required
* Repeatable configuration across a large set of servers

### Cons
* Extensive logic can be difficult
* No UI
* Large learning curve

Replaces [Chef (All)]() for on-premise configuration and provisioning. Consider [Terraform]() or [AWS Cloud Formation]() for cloud infrastructure provisioning.
