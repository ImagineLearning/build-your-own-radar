[Chef Infra](https://www.chef.io/products/chef-infra/) automates infrastructure configuration, ensuring every system is configured correctly and consistently. Relatively new addition to the infrastructure as code arena but [Terraform]() or [Cloud Formation]() are strongly preferred. 

### Pros
* Manage your infrastructure declaratively 
* Drift detection
* Easty to get started

### Cons
* Lack of community support
* Not open source
