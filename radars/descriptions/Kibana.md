[Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/kibana/) is a source-available data visualization dashboard software for Elasticsearch, whose free and open source fork in OpenSearch is OpenSearch Dashboards.  Kibana provides visualization capabilities on top of the content indexed on an Elasticsearch cluster. Users can create bar, line and scatter plots, or pie charts and maps on top of large volumes of data.[4]

Kibana also provides a presentation tool, referred to as Canvas, that allows users to create slide decks that pull live data directly from Elasticsearch.  See also [Elastic Stack](https://www.elastic.co/what-is/elk-stack).
