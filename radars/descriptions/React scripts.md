### Pros

- Create new React applications with no build configuration.
- Single dependency for build tooling.
- Support for ES6, [TypeScript](), and [SASS]() right out of the box.

### Cons

- Opinionated configuration. Not easily customizable without ejecting.
- Focused on building single-page applications. Not well suited for building libraries or applications with server-side rendering.
