[React Native](https://reactnative.dev) is a framework for building native mobile applications using [React]().

### Pros

- Create truly native apps while writing React code in JavaScript or [TypeScript]().
- Target multiple platforms from a single codebase.
- Maintained by Facebook with a massive community around it.

### Cons

- Can have performance problems.
- Still hasn't hit a 1.0 release. Developers can run into breaking changes in tools and dependencies between versions.
- Still need native mobile development experience for implementing more advanced features.
