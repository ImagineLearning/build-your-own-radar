[.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/about) is the successor the .NET framework. It differs from the legacy .NET framework by being cross platform and open source. In many respects .NET core has learned from Node and Ruby and other languages and made a modern ecosystem for C# programmers. AWS Lambda functions are a great way to run snippets of code without worrying about the underlying infrastructure the code would run on. Currently this is most useful as means to cheaply process events from Kinesis, DynamoDb streams, SNS, or SQS. AWS has provided all of the plumbing to handle this efficiently. 

### Pros
* Works well as Kubernetes jobs
* Small and lightweight containers
* Fast background processing
* Native asynchronous support

### Cons
* Not as wide of a package base as some other language frameworks
* Cannot be compiled as a single standalone binary (you must have .Net Core runtime available)
