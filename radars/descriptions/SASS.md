[Sass](https://sass-lang.com) claims to be the most mature, stable, and powerful professional grade CSS extension language in the world.

### Pros

- Completely compatible with all versions of CSS.
- Makes sharing styles throughout your application more convenient through variables and mixins.
- Actively supported and developed by a consortium of several tech companies and hundreds of developers.
- Faster than [LESS]().

### Cons

- Makes it really easy to write bad CSS, like deeply nested selectors.
- Another thing to configure in your build tooling.
