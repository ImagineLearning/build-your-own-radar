[Concourse CI](https://concourse-ci.org/) is an open-source continuous thing-doer. Built on the simple mechanics of resources, tasks, and jobs, Concourse presents a general approach to automation that makes it great for CI/CD. Could potentially replace [Spinnaker]() for CI.

### Pros
* Native Kubernetes support
