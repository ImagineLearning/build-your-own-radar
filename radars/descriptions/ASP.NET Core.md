[ASP.NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/learn/aspnet/what-is-aspnet-core) is built on the new [.NET Core]() framework but is designed for the web. As with .NET Core this is an open source framework. While ASP.NET can be used for server side rendering pages the WNE strong preference is that the frontend apps are single page applications (SPAs) using [React]().

### Pros
* One of the fastest web frameworks around today
* Works very well in containers
* Great support for building APIs

### Cons
* Lack of packages in some scenarios
