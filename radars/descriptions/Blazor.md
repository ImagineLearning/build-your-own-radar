[Blazor](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor) lets you build interactive web UIs using C# instead of JavaScript. Blazor apps are composed of reusable web UI components implemented using C#, HTML, and CSS. Both client and server code is written in C#, allowing you to share code and libraries.

### Pros
- Allows engineers with C# experience to easily create a web app
- Great for an internal tool
- Tool can potentially work offline with client-side Blazor
- Can use familiar .NET libraries in your web application

### Cons
- Lack of community support
- Limited debugging tooling
- Relatively new and unproven in the market
- Requires webassembly enabled browser for client-side Blazor

\*\* At this time should only be used for internal tools. [React]() is the primary front end framework.

\*\* Consider carefully if the application should use server-side Blazor or client-side Blazor
