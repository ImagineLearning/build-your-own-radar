[Aurora Serverless (Postgres compatible)](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/serverless/?nc=sn&loc=2&dn=6) is an on-demand, auto-scaling configuration for Amazon Aurora (MySQL-compatible and PostgreSQL-compatible editions), where the database will automatically start up, shut down, and scale capacity up or down based on your application's needs. It enables you to run your database in the cloud without managing any database instances. It's a simple, cost-effective option for infrequent, intermittent, or unpredictable workloads.

### Pros
* Much cheaper than RDS provisioned instances
* Auto scaling
* Great for dev and test databases

### Cons
* Will not perform as well as some other options
* Only supported with specific versions of Postgres

*** Should only be considered for non production use cases ***
