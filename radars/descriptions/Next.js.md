[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) is a framework for building server-side rendered [React]() applications. It provides a full-featured developer experience out of the box, with a wide array of plugins.

### Pros
- Build server-side rendered (SSR) React apps with little to no configuration. Also supports static site generation.
- Comes with a page-based routing system, static optimization, server-side rendering with data-fetching, automatic code-splitting, client-side routing with page pre-fetching, built-in CSS and [SASS]() support, and API routes.
- Opinionated framework for more consistent project structure.

### Cons
- File-based navigation does not allow for dynamic routes.
- Must run on a Node server (unless using static site generation).
- Opinionated framework locks you in to the Next.js way of routing, data fetching, etc.
