[GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools.


### Pros
* Front end developers don't have to wait for backend engineers to adjust apis
* Combine data from multiple sources in a single request
* Self documented

### Cons
* Possible to create extremely costly queries unintentionally 
* Lacks support by all libraries and packages
