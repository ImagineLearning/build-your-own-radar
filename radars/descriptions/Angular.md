[Angular](https://angular.io) is an application design framework and development platform for creating efficient and sophisticated single-page apps.

### Pros

- Opinionated framework with many services baked in, such as routing, HTTP client, etc.
- Angular team provides an official style guide and CLI tool, which help maintain consistent file and code structure across projects.
- Framework built around dependency injection for greater testability of isolated services and components.

### Cons

- Steep learning curve. Even for developers coming from [AngularJS](), the framework is completely different. It follows some sophisticated design patterns that can be difficult to understand at first.
- Requires a lot more boilerplate code than its contemporaries.
