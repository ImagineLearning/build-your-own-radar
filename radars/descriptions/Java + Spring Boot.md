[Java + Spring Boot](https://spring.io/) makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring based Applications that you can "just run".

We take an opinionated view of the Spring platform and third-party libraries so you can get started with minimum fuss. Most Spring Boot applications need minimal Spring configuration.

### Pros
* Spring is the most popular Java framework
* Opinionated framework makes creating applications easy
* Not as heavy as full 
* Massive amount of third party libraries available

### Cons
* Unused libraries can bloat overall application size 
* Limited control of your application
