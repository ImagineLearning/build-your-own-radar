[Kubernetes]() is the best container orchestration system around. AWS has decided to make it a first class citizen on AWS by offering a managed system. The idea here is to make it easier to maintain your k8s cluster for minimal cost.

### Pros
* Easy to set up
* Easier to stay up to date with k8s releases through managed nodes
* Don't have to worry about the control plane (master nodes)
* More strictly adheres to best security practices
* Integrated IAM support (though can be added to home spun clusters)

### Cons
* Tied to AWS
* Less ability to customize

### Trial Goal
The goal of trialing EKS is see if we can become more efficient and stay up to date without manually upgrading the cluster constantly with added security.
