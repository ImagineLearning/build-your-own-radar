[Grafana OnCall](https://grafana.com/oss/oncall/) is an open source, easy-to-use on-call management tool built to help teams improve their collaboration and resolve incidents faster.

Grafana OnCall (formerly known as Amixr) was started in 2018 at Amixr Inc., which Grafana Labs acquired in 2021. Launched on Grafana Cloud in late 2021 and open sourced in 2022 for users needing self-managed and on-premises deployments, Grafana OnCall provides an on-call management solution that is simple to use, accessible to everyone, and allows engineers to actually sleep well at night knowing that only the relevant notifications will reach them. Grafana Labs uses Grafana OnCall to run its own cloud services.
