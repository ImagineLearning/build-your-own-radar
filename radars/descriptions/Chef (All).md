[Chef (All)](https://www.chef.io/) automates infrastructure configuration, ensuring every system is configured correctly and consistently. 

### Pros
* Manage your infrastructure declaratively 
* Drift detection
* Easy to replicate environments

### Cons
* Lack of community support
* Not open source
* Steep learning curve
* Requires scripting for very common tasks

Relatively new addition to the infrastructure as code arena but [Terraform]() or [Cloud Formation]() are strongly preferred.
