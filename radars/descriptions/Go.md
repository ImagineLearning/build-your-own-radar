[Go](https://golang.org/) is a C style language with influence from JAVA. Go is expressive, concise, clean, and efficient. Its concurrency mechanisms make it easy to write programs that get the most out of multicore and networked machines, while its novel type system enables flexible and modular program construction. Go compiles quickly to machine code yet has the convenience of garbage collection and the power of run-time reflection. It's a fast, statically typed, compiled language that feels like a dynamically typed, interpreted language.


### Pros
* Extremely fast
* Compiles to machine code
* Concise and clean
* Great for frameworks or multithreaded jobs

### Cons
* Package management is still lacking
* Not well suited for web apis
