The [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/cli) is a command-line interface tool that you use to initialize, develop, scaffold, and maintain Angular applications.

### Pros

- Create new Angular applications with no build configuration.
- Provides consistent project structure across projects.
- Support for [TypeScript]() and [SASS]() right out of the box.
- Provides scaffolding for generating modules, components, directives, services, pipes, etc. to reduce boilerplate.

### Cons

- Not easily customizable without ejecting.
- Lots of commands and options, making it a little unweildy.
