Jest is a delightful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity.

### Pros

- Works out of the box, config free, on most JavaScript projects.
- Already built into [React scripts]().
- Runs fast, running previously failed tests first and reorganizing runs based on how long test files take.
- Includes functionality for dependency mocking, snapshot testing, and parallelization.

### Cons

- Doesn't have as large a community around it as [Karma]()/[Jasmine]().
- Runs tests in a Node process by default, which can be harder to debug than tests run in a browser.

Replaces [Karma]() and [Jasmine]().
