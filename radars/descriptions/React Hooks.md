[React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-overview.html) are functions that let you “hook into” React state and lifecycle features from function components.
React provides [a few built-in Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html), like `useState` for managing state, `useEffect` for performing side-effects.

### Pros

- Add stateful behavior to function components.
- Use more of React's features without classes.
- Allow creation of [custom Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-custom.html), facilitating reuse of stateful logic across components.
- Completely opt-in and 100% backwards compatible.

### Cons

- Requires a different mental model from traditional lifecycle methods in class components.
- Less separation of concerns, since business logic can be more easily added to function components.
