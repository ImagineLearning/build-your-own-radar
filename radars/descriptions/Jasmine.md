[Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/) is a behavior-driven development framework for testing JavaScript code.

### Pros

- Does not depend on other JavaScript frameworks and does not require a DOM.
- Widely used, with a large community around it.
- Includes a wide variety of built-in assertions/matchers.

### Cons

- Does not include a test runner, making it reliant on other tools like [Karma]().
