[LESS](http://lesscss.org/) is a CSS extension language, similar to [SASS]().

### Pros

- Makes sharing styles throughout your application more convenient through variables and mixins.
- Allows a more programmatic approach to writing styles, with less redundant code.

### Cons

- Slower than [SASS]().
- Makes it really easy to write bad CSS, like deeply nested selectors.
- Another thing to configure in your build tooling.
