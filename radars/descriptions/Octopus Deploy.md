[Octopus Deploy](https://octopus.com/) You already have a source control system and a build server. Octopus doesn't replace these, we turbocharge them. We allow the build server to focus on what it does best: compiling code and running tests, while Octopus takes care of deploying and promoting releases between environments, automating deployments, and automating the operations tasks that keep the software running. 


### Pros
* Focused on release management
* Works with both cloud deployments and on premise deployments
* Inexpensive
* UI is easy for engineers and others to control releases
* High level dashboard view of releases

### Cons
* Requires an agent for on premise servers
* Configuration can get complicated very quickly
* Small community and very few plugins
