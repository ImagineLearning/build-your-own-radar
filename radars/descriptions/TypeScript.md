A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.

### Pros

- Types enable use of highly-productive development tools and practices like static checking and code refactoring.
- Support for the latest and evolving JavaScript features.
- Supported by [Angular CLI]() and [React scripts]().

### Cons

- Defining types can add to "boilerplate" code.
- Adding JavaScript libraries without type definitions requires jumping through additional hoops.
- Lacks the flexibility that comes with dynamic types in JavaScript.
