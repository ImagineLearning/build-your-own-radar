[AWS EMR](https://aws.amazon.com/emr/?nc=sn&loc=1&whats-new-cards.sort-by=item.additionalFields.postDateTime&whats-new-cards.sort-order=desc) is the industry-leading cloud big data platform for processing vast amounts of data using open source tools such as Apache Spark, Apache Hive, Apache HBase, Apache Flink, Apache Hudi, and Presto. With EMR you can run Petabyte-scale analysis at less than half of the cost of traditional on-premises solutions and over 3x faster than standard Apache Spark.
