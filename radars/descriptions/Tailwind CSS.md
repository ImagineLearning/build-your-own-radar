[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) is a highly customizable, low-level CSS framework that gives you all of the building blocks you need to build bespoke designs without any annoying opinionated styles you have to fight to override.

### Pros

- Provides low-level utility classes that let you build completely custom designs without writing any CSS.
- All utility classes come with responsive variants, facilitating mobile-first design.
- Highly customizable. Allows configuring colors, border sizes, font weights, spacing utilities, breapoints, shadows, and more.

### Cons

- It's recommended to use as a [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/) plugin, which requires extra configuration with build tools.
- Larger learning curve due to the number of utility classes available.
- Can result in massive CSS bundles if tooling is not configured to purge unused classes for production builds.
