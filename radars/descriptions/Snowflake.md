[Snowflake](hhttps://www.snowflake.com/) is a modern data warehouse meant to augment data lakes. 

Generally speaking Api Gateway is a cool technology but there is a strong preference to run appliations on our existing [Kubernetes]() clusters to take advantage of free resources that are already available. 

### Pros
* Very fast scale up of resources
* CPU and storage capacities can be configured separately
* Automatic performance tuning
* Fully managed infrastructure
* Cheaper than some other data warehouse technologies
* Supports multi cloud
* Simple to setup and get started
* Direct integration into other services

### Cons
* No on premise option
* May not perform as well as other technologies when optimized
