[Redux](https://redux.js.org/) is a predictable state container for JavaScript applications.

### Pros
- Centralized logic for managing global application state. Not tied to view.
- One-way data flow makes it easy to test and debug.
- Easily extensible via middleware.

### Cons

- Requires more "boilerplate" code.
- Performance implications for too much state in global store.
- Difficult for inexperienced developers to determine what belongs in Redux.
