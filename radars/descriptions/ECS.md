[Elastic Container Service (ECS)](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/) is a fully managed container orchestration service. Customers such as Duolingo, Samsung, GE, and Cookpad use ECS to run their most sensitive and mission critical applications because of its security, reliability, and scalability.

### Pros
* Support for serverless containers through Fargate
* AWS native
* Managed infrastructure

### Cons
* Lacks community support
* Only works with AWS

While ECS and Kubernetes are very similar [Kubernetes]() is favored heavily.
